This repo contains a QPA plugin to make Qt a Mir server.

To use, compile and install, run:

export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=mirserver
export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/imports/Unity-Mir

then run the Qt application of your choice (qmlscene best). As example, try

qmlscene demoShell.qml

and then try running another application:

mir_demo_client_egltriangle --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/gallery-app.desktop
