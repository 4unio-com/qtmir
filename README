This repo contains a QPA plugin to make Qt a Mir server.

Handiest way to grab dependencies:
$ apt-get build-dep qtubuntu
$ apt-get install libupstart-app-launch1-dev

If using Qt version less than 5.2, you'll also need
$ apt-get install libqt5v8-5-private-dev

To use, compile and install, run:

$ export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=mirserver
# work around a crash if that dir doesn't exist. Don't ask me why.
$ sudo mkdir /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/fonts 

then run the Qt application of your choice (qmlscene best). As example, try

$ qmlscene qml-demo-shell/qml-demo-shell.qml

and then try running an application:

$ mir_demo_client_egltriangle --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/gallery-app.desktop
